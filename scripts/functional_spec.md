# Functional Specification: Real-time Anomaly Detection System

## 1. Overview

The system shall ingest financial transaction data in real-time, analyze it for anomalous patterns using statistical methods, machine learning models, and custom rules, and provide insights and alerts to operators via a dashboard and notification system.

## 2. Data Ingestion

*   The system must be able to consume transaction data streams from Apache Kafka topics.
*   Support for consuming data via secure WebSockets shall be considered.
*   Incoming data must be validated against a predefined schema. Invalid data should be logged and potentially quarantined.
*   Target processing latency from ingestion to anomaly detection should be under 5 seconds for P95.

## 3. Anomaly Detection Capabilities

*   The system shall detect anomalies based on:
    *   **Statistical deviations:** Significant changes in transaction amount, frequency, or velocity compared to historical norms (e.g., per user, per merchant).
    *   **Machine Learning models:** Identification of complex, non-linear patterns indicative of anomalies using unsupervised learning.
    *   **Configurable Rules:** User-defined criteria based on transaction attributes (e.g., high amount from new location, multiple failed attempts).
*   Detection thresholds and rule parameters must be configurable without requiring code deployment.
*   The system should assign a severity score or level to detected anomalies.

## 4. Dashboard & Visualization

*   A web-based dashboard shall provide authorized users with a near real-time view of detected anomalies.
*   Users must be able to filter and search anomalies based on time range, severity, type, user ID, transaction ID, etc.
*   The dashboard should display key details for each anomaly, including the reason(s) for detection and associated transaction information.
*   Basic visualizations (e.g., time series charts of anomaly counts, distribution plots) should be available.
*   The dashboard shall display high-level system health indicators.
*   Role-based access control must restrict access to sensitive data and administrative functions.

## 5. Alerting & Notifications

*   The system shall generate alerts for high-severity anomalies based on configurable criteria.
*   Alerts must be deliverable via Email and Slack integrations. Support for other channels (e.g., SMS, PagerDuty) may be added later.
*   Alert content should be concise and informative, providing key details and a link to the dashboard for further investigation.
*   Mechanisms for alert throttling and deduplication must be implemented to avoid alert fatigue.

## 6. System Administration

*   Authorized administrators shall be able to configure detection parameters, rules, and alert settings.
*   System monitoring and basic performance metrics should be accessible.
