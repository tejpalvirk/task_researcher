# Project Plan: Real-time Anomaly Detection System

## Phase 1: Core Infrastructure & Data Ingestion (Target: Month 1)

*   **Task 1.1:** Setup project structure, CI/CD basics (Linting, testing placeholders), and Poetry environment.
*   **Task 1.2:** Design core data schemas (Pydantic models) for transactions and detected anomalies.
*   **Task 1.3:** Provision foundational cloud infrastructure (e.g., VPC, basic K8s cluster/managed service, PostgreSQL/TimescaleDB instance, Kafka cluster). Use Terraform/Pulumi.
*   **Task 1.4:** Implement Data Ingestion Service:
    *   Connects to upstream Kafka topic(s) or WebSocket feed(s).
    *   Validates incoming transaction data against schema.
    *   Handles basic data enrichment (e.g., timestamping).
    *   Publishes validated transactions to an internal Kafka topic.
*   **Task 1.5:** Implement basic logging and monitoring infrastructure (e.g., setup Prometheus/Grafana basics).

## Phase 2: Feature Engineering & Basic Anomaly Detection (Target: Month 2-3)

*   **Task 2.1:** Develop Feature Engineering Module:
    *   Consumes validated transactions from Kafka.
    *   Calculates basic features (e.g., transaction frequency per user, rolling averages, time-based features).
    *   Stores engineered features potentially back to Kafka or directly accessible by detection service.
*   **Task 2.2:** Implement Statistical Anomaly Detection Service (v1):
    *   Consumes engineered features.
    *   Applies simple statistical methods (e.g., Z-score, IQR on transaction amounts/frequency).
    *   Detects outliers based on configurable thresholds.
*   **Task 2.3:** Design and implement storage for detected anomalies (in PostgreSQL/TimescaleDB).
*   **Task 2.4:** Develop initial integration tests between Ingestion, Feature Engineering, and Detection services.

## Phase 3: Advanced ML Models & Rule Engine (Target: Month 4-5)

*   **Task 3.1:** Research and select appropriate unsupervised ML models (e.g., Isolation Forest, Autoencoder, LOF).
*   **Task 3.2:** Implement ML Model Training Pipeline:
    *   Offline pipeline to train selected models on historical data.
    *   Integrate with MLflow for experiment tracking and model versioning.
*   **Task 3.3:** Integrate trained ML models into a new ML Anomaly Detection Service (v2):
    *   Loads versioned models from MLflow.
    *   Scores incoming transactions/features in near real-time.
    *   Handles model updates/rollbacks.
*   **Task 3.4:** Implement a Configurable Rule Engine Service:
    *   Allows defining custom rules based on features (e.g., "amount > X AND location = Y").
    *   Applies rules alongside statistical/ML detection.
*   **Task 3.5:** Combine outputs from Statistical, ML, and Rule-based detection into a unified anomaly stream/database entry.

## Phase 4: Dashboard, API & Alerting (Target: Month 6-7)

*   **Task 4.1:** Design and implement a REST API (FastAPI) to query detected anomalies and system status. Include filtering and pagination.
*   **Task 4.2:** Implement user authentication/authorization for the API (e.g., JWT).
*   **Task 4.3:** Develop a Web Dashboard (e.g., React/Vue frontend):
    *   Displays detected anomalies in a table/list.
    *   Provides basic visualization of anomaly trends.
    *   Allows users to view transaction details associated with an anomaly.
    *   Shows basic system health metrics from monitoring.
*   **Task 4.4:** Implement Alerting Service:
    *   Consumes high-priority anomalies.
    *   Sends notifications via configurable channels (Email, Slack).
    *   Manages alert throttling/deduplication.

## Phase 5: Performance, Scalability & Deployment Hardening (Target: Month 8+)

*   **Task 5.1:** Conduct performance testing (using Locust/k6) on critical services (Ingestion, Detection).
*   **Task 5.2:** Optimize database queries and indexing for anomaly storage.
*   **Task 5.3:** Implement autoscaling for K8s deployments based on load metrics (CPU, memory, Kafka lag).
*   **Task 5.4:** Enhance monitoring: Add detailed application-level metrics and distributed tracing.
*   **Task 5.5:** Finalize production deployment configuration, security hardening, and documentation.
*   **Task 5.6:** Setup backup and recovery procedures for databases and models.
