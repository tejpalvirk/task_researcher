# Background & Context: Real-time Anomaly Detection

## Problem Domain

The financial industry faces ever-increasing volumes of digital transactions. Detecting fraudulent or anomalous activities in real-time is crucial for minimizing financial losses, maintaining customer trust, and complying with regulations. Traditional rule-based systems often struggle to keep up with evolving fraud tactics and generate high false-positive rates.

## Need for Advanced Detection

There is a clear need for systems that can:

1.  **Process high-throughput data streams** with low latency.
2.  **Identify novel and complex patterns** that simple rules might miss, leveraging machine learning.
3.  **Adapt to changing data distributions** and fraud patterns (concept drift).
4.  **Provide interpretable results** to allow investigators to understand *why* a transaction was flagged.
5.  **Minimize false positives** to avoid disrupting legitimate customer activity and reduce operational overhead.

## Relevant Technologies & Approaches

*   **Stream Processing:** Frameworks like Kafka Streams, Flink, or custom Python consumers/producers are common for handling real-time data flow.
*   **Time-Series Databases:** Databases optimized for time-stamped data (like TimescaleDB, InfluxDB) are well-suited for storing transaction features and detected events.
*   **Unsupervised Learning:** Techniques like Isolation Forests, Local Outlier Factor (LOF), One-Class SVM, and Autoencoders are frequently used for anomaly detection when labeled fraud data is scarce or unreliable.
*   **Feature Engineering:** Creating informative features from raw transaction data (e.g., aggregates over time windows, categorical embeddings) is critical for model performance.
*   **MLOps:** Practices and tools (like MLflow, Kubeflow) are essential for managing the lifecycle of ML models in production, including training, versioning, deployment, and monitoring.

## Key Challenges

*   **Scalability:** Handling potentially millions of transactions per hour.
*   **Latency:** Ensuring detection happens within seconds of the transaction event.
*   **Accuracy:** Balancing detection rates (true positives) with low false-positive rates.
*   **Adaptability:** Dealing with data drift and evolving adversarial patterns.
*   **Explainability:** Understanding ML model decisions, especially for regulatory purposes or investigations.
*   **Integration:** Combining insights from statistical methods, ML models, and business rules effectively.
